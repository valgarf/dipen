- cancel running transitions on start
- store arcs for transition / place on net (BTree with transition id first?)
- python bindings
- tests (with multiprocessing?)
- visualization
- mark running transitions?
- store 'last_changed', 'last_start_firing', 'last_finished_firing', etc. time from local time?
- statistics (transitions / s, how often each was fired?)
- remove transitions from own region on etcd, if not in configuration?
