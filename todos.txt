- Readme
- improve python bindings
    * error handling could be improved (what should a transition do if the python run function fails?)
    * API not very pythonic
    * registry data not passed through to validate / create
    * pass cancellation through to running python transitions
    * improve logging include fields from scopes, log scope start / end
- tests for this package
- simplify testing for users
    * implement a 'local' runner for testing (extract etcd logic into traits)
    * snapshottest, i.e. replay run based on a stored run, allow storing the run (special runner?)
    * export (parts of) the etcd history to be used for tests
- Visualization (with history from etcd?)
    * mark running transitions? currently not stored on etcd
    * human readable reasoning for not firing?
- time data:
    * store 'last_changed', 'last_start_firing', 'last_finished_firing', etc. time from local time?
      -> startup time for initial load?
    * store local time of runners on etcd with every update? Could be used in visualization to show
      an estimated time of the last change
- migration strategies / manual interaction:
    * remove transitions from own region on etcd, if not in current configuration?
      -> 'transfer' of transition region: first update runner that does not use the transition anymore, then update runner for the new region
    * allow manual blocking of regions / transitions (will not start firing)
    * allow manual cancellation of regions / transitins (cancel currently running)
    * prepared 'manual transitions' that only fire on manual input (with additional provided data)?
    * 'ad hoc' manual transtions that take / place from / to arbitrary places with arbitrary updates to modify state?
- statistics (transitions / s, how often was each transition fired)?
