- fix random 'check one transition multiple times' bug
- improve logging on python (include fields from scopes, log scope start / end)
- extract etcd logic into traits
- tests (with multiprocessing?)
- visualization
- mark running transitions?
- human readable reasoning for not firing?
- store 'last_changed', 'last_start_firing', 'last_finished_firing', etc. time from local time?
    -> startup time for initial load?
- remove transitions from own region on etcd, if not in configuration?
- statistics (transitions / s, how often was each transition fired)?
